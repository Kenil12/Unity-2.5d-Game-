A4 - Group - 15 (Jenil Bhindi, Taqi Farooqui, Anurag Sake, Kenil Chovatiya)

Note: Please watch the gameplay video in the documentation Folder.

There are minor adjustments I have made to the assignment.

Bubble Popper: I named the game bubble-burster (because of alliteration) and the scene is called "A4G". 
This scene lives outside the scenes folder. I also used semi-transperent circle instead of sphere. Since my game runs in 2D, it made
more sense to use circles. All of the other requirements are fulfilled as mentioned in the assignment.

Painting: I named this game as "Painter-Man" (because its sounds cooler), the scene is called "Fresh"  (inside the scenes folder).
I know the assignment mentioned to have 4 circle of different colour that would change the colour of the brush. Instead I decided to 
put those on the top in shape of a pen because it looked better. All of the other requirements are fulfilled as mentioned in the assignment.

CubeNinja: This scene is named as "Cninja" (inside scenes folder). Since my game is in 2D, I decided to use Squares (Quad object) instead
of the cube. All of the other requirements are fulfilled as mentioned in the assignment.
